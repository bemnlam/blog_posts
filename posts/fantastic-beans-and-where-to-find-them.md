## Background ##

*In short: I found some local shops which selling pretty good beans. In Hong Kong.*

During the 2020 pandamic, it's not easy to buy beans overseas. However, it gave me a great opportunity to search for some good beans in Hong Kong. Plus, I have more time to stay at home and brew coffee as the company started the WFH policy from Feb.

This is also a restaurant so you can taste their coffee with delicious food. Ocassionally the shop will held cultural talks.

The shop is selling one of the lightest roasted whole beans in the city. I bought the Ethiopia Guji beans a long time ago and tasted the Americano in the shop. Both stunning.
