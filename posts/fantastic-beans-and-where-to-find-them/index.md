## Background

*In short: I found some local shops which selling pretty good beans. In Hong Kong.*

During the 2020 pandamic, it's not easy to buy beans overseas. However, it gave me a great opportunity to search for some good beans in Hong Kong. Plus, I have more time to stay at home and brew coffee as the company started the WFH policy from Feb.

### Update history

🏷 2020-09-12:

- Added new beans I tried.
- Added new equipments.

*I will keep searching for new beans and new local shops in the coming days.*

The shop sells whole beans, drip bags and a lot of coffee equipment. You can also request the shopkeeper to gring the beans too.

I bought their beans twice a week. Here are some beans that I've tried and the labels of each kind of bean.

### Beans

**🌞 El Salvador, Finca La Primera** 

- Nutty, brown sugar, citrus, sweet aftertaste.
- Variety: Bourbon, 1200m ~ 1600m

**🌊 Ethiopia Guji Shakisso Abiyot Boru Galle Dagaa Grade 1**

- Great acidity & full mouth feel with notes like raisin, blackberry, dark choco., plum & honey-like sweetness.

**🌊 Colombia Hulla Mariano Leal Bourbon**

**🌊 Kenya Nyala AB Top Microlot**

**🍷 Yunnan (Brandy Fermentation)** : This one is super interesting and addictive. Strong brandy / rum taste.

### Drip bags

- The shop also grinds their beans and sell it as drop bags (~$75/10 bags). Suitable for people who want to drink their own choice in the office.

### Equipments

#### Coffee filter
**KONO**

While V60 is dominating the market (I also using plastic V60. Cheap, robust, simple), this shop don't sell V60. Instead, KONO filter is all over the shop.

**Clever Cup**

They sold clever cup recently. In my opinion, it is a french press but looks like a drip coffee filter. You can also use it as a typical coffee filter if you want.

**The Vietnamese**

Once apon a time I drank the vietnamese coffee from a local restaurant and it used this coffee filter to brew a dark and strong coffee and mixed with condensed milk. (So strong that I got a headache afterwards X.X)

The shop is selling one of the lightest roasted whole beans in the city. I bought the Ethiopia Guji beans a long time ago and tasted the Americano in the shop. Both stunning.
