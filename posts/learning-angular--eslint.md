Here are 3 notes on ESLint warnings/errors when developing Angular app:

For each `<a>` with user interaction e.g. `(click)`, you have to define at least one **keyboard** interaction together with tab index e.g.

```html
<a (click)="clickHandler" (keyup.enter)="clickHandler" [tabindex]="0">
	This is a link which allow user to click with accessbility
</a>
```

If a value is a Typescript Enum and you want to compare with a number, add `.valueOf` e.g.

```js
somePropertyWithTypeEnum.valueOf() = anIntegerYouWantToCompare;
```

Adding a hash and pass `.value` when dealing with Mat-select input handler:

```html
<mat-select id="{{question.id}}" formControlName="{{question.id}}"
	#selectInput	(input)="onSearchChange(selectInput.value)"
	(change)="questionFilled()">
```
