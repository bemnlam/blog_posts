## The Exam

I passed the [**City & Guilds International Barista Skills**](https://www.cityandguilds.com/qualifications-and-apprenticeships/hospitality-and-catering/hospitality-and-catering/7102-barista-skills) exam this December and I think that will be a good idea to write down what I've learnt.

## The Notebook

As a result, this notebook is created 👉 https://coffeelab.lofibean.cc/. 

(The notebook is powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and you can find out how to create a site like that [here](/posts/documentation-makes-easy-with-mkdocs-and-gitlab-pages/).)

Enjoy ☕️
