## The Birthday Present Guide {#the-bday-guide}

Check out the `/usr/share/misc/birthtoken`[^2] and see which gem and flower (looks like someone in Berkeley knows about the flowers really well) you should buy for your friends!

> *"Oh why you choose this gem and that flower as the present?"*
>
> *"Um... that's my computer's idea..."*

### More About Perl and Ruby

The creator of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) chose the name *Ruby* because it was [the birthstone of one of his colleagues](https://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/FAQ/FAQ.html) and that is the gem right after Pearl ([Perl](https://www.perl.org/)).

**Lesson learnt:** when you try to name a new language you invented, you should check this file out!

```
# Birthday : Birth Stone : Birth Flower

## Mac is a Secret Fan of... {#mac-is-a-secret-fan-of}

The `/usr/share/calendar` folder contains some useful calendars but this one really catches my eye:

-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   1.4K Dec 14  2019 calendar.lotr
```

This is a timeline of the important events happened in The Lord Of The Rings[^3]:

## Bonus: the missing recipe {#bonus-recipe}

In the eariler versions of the macOS, **a hidden cookie recipe** can be found by typing this command in the Terminal:

```bash
Open /usr/share/emacs/22.1/etc/COOKIES
```

Unforrunately in the latest macOS this file is gone (together with `/usr/share/emacs`). We can only check this out [on the apple opensource website](https://opensource.apple.com/source/emacs/emacs-96/emacs/etc/COOKIES.auto.html)[^4].
