## 🎯 Summary

As a human being, **managing our energy is more important** because this is a limited resources. 

We may wrongly think that increasing working hours can do more. However, longer working hours leads more **unfocus** time and brings negative effect to your work.

Surprisingly, having a monthly plan is better then a detailed daily plan. The later one demotivated people because we face **inevitable distractions** daily.

## 💡 Thoughts
- Stay focus on work by taking regular breaks. (e.g [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique))
- In the article, top 10% productive employees **work 52-mins work and take 17-mins break**.
- Regularly schedule some time for work individually without distraction.

## ⭐️  Highlights
>  A workplace study found an average working professional experiences 87 interruptions per day, making it difficult to remain productive and focused for a full day.

> Surprisingly, the top 10 percent of employees with the highest productivity didn’t put in longer hours than anyone else – often they didn't even work eight-hour days. Instead, the key to their productivity was that for every 52 minutes of focused work, they took a 17-minute break. 

> “At any given point, I should have deep work scheduled for roughly the next month. Once on the calendar, I protect this time like I would a doctor’s appointment or important meeting,”

> While the researchers assumed that the well-structured daily plans would be most effective when it came to the execution of tasks, they were wrong: the detailed daily plans demotivated students. Harford argues that inevitable distractions often render the daily to-do list ineffective, while leaving room for improvisation in such a list can reap the best results.
